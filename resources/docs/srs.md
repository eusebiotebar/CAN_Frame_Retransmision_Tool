# CAN Frame Retransmission Tool (SRS)

---

## Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a PyQt6-based Python desktop application. The primary purpose of this application is to detect and interface with Kvaser CAN devices, allowing users to select distinct input and output CAN channels, configure bitrates, and retransmit CAN frames from the input to the output channel after rewriting their CAN IDs based on a user-defined mapping table.

### Objectives

The main objectives of this software are:

* To provide a user-friendly graphical interface for configuring CAN retransmission.
* To enable reliable detection and selection of Kvaser CAN devices and channels.
* To facilitate the real-time retransmission of CAN frames with configurable ID rewriting.
* To offer clear status feedback and display of the latest received frames.

### Scope

**The system shall perform the following functions:**

* Detect and list available Kvaser CAN devices and their channels.
* Allow user selection of one input and one output CAN channel, ensuring they are distinct.
* Allow user configuration of bitrate for input and output channels, defaulting to 250 kbps.
* Implement a "Start/Stop frame retransmission" mechanism.
* Display a real-time view of the latest received CAN frames.
* Provide a status indicator for the retransmission process.
* Apply user-configurable CAN ID rewriting rules.
* Log system events and CAN frame activity to the console and an optional file.

**The system shall NOT perform the following functions:**

* Perform any database operations or data persistence beyond logging.
* Decode CAN frames using DBC files or interpret their payload beyond raw data.
* Control or modify any physical actuators or external systems based on CAN frame content.
* Support CAN devices other than Kvaser via the `python-can` Kvaser backend.
* Provide network-based remote control or monitoring.

### Validity

This SRS document is considered valid from the date of its initial publication (Version 1.0) and will remain in force until a new version explicitly replaces it. Any changes, additions, or deletions of requirements must be managed through the defined update scheme and documented in subsequent versions.

### Update Scheme

Updates to this SRS document will be carried out through a formal change control process. All significant modifications must be reviewed, approved, and documented in the `Version History` table at the beginning of the document, including the version number, a concise description of the changes, the date of modification, and the responsible author. Minor versions may be internally documented and published as necessary, but will not be formally released until they meet the criteria for a major version update.

## Definition of the System and the System Boundaries

### General Information

The CAN Frame Retransmission Tool is a desktop application designed for engineers and developers working with CAN bus systems. It simplifies the process of testing and debugging CAN networks by allowing flexible retransmission and ID modification of CAN messages without needing complex hardware setups.

### Definition of the System

The system is a standalone Python application, utilizing the PyQt6 framework for its GUI and the `python-can` library with the Kvaser backend for CAN communication. Its core function is to facilitate the flow of CAN frames between two distinct Kvaser CAN channels, applying a user-configurable ID rewrite mapping.

#### System Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

* **GUI (PyQt6):** Provides the user interface for configuration, control, and monitoring.
* **CAN Manager:** Wraps `python-can` functionalities for device and channel management.
* **Frame Processor:** Applies CAN ID rewriting rules based on user configuration.
* **Logging Module:** Manages logging of application events and errors.

The following diagram illustrates the system architecture:

### System Boundaries

**The system SHALL perform the following actions:**

* Poll for and display available Kvaser CAN devices and their channels.
* Validate user input for channel selection (input and output channels must be unique).
* Open and close CAN bus connections via `python-can`.
* Continuously monitor the selected input CAN channel for incoming frames when retransmission is active.
* Apply the CAN ID mapping table to frames received on the input channel.
* Transmit modified frames to the selected output CAN channel.
* Provide visual feedback on the operational status of the retransmission process.
* Allow dynamic modification of the CAN ID mapping table during runtime (when retransmission is stopped).
* Handle and report errors related to CAN communication (e.g., bus-off, device not found).

**The system SHALL NOT perform the following actions:**

* Manage or install Kvaser device drivers. It assumes drivers are pre-installed.
* Provide an API for external systems to interact with it.
* Persist configuration or logging data across application restarts, unless explicitly configured for file logging.
* Interact with the operating system beyond standard file I/O for logging and GUI rendering.
